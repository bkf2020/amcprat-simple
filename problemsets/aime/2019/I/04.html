	<h2>2019 AIME I Problem 4</h2>
<div class="cmty-view-post-item-text">A soccer team has 22 available players. A fixed set of 11 players starts the game, while the other 11 are available as substitutes. During the game, the coach may make as many as 3 substitutions, where any one of the 11 players in the game is replaced by one of the substitutes. No player removed from the game may reenter the game, although a substitute entering the game may be replaced later. No two substitutions can happen at the same time. The players involved and the order of the substitutions matter. Let <img alt="$n$" class="latex" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/1/7/4/174fadd07fd54c9afe288e96558c92e0c1da733a.png" style="width: calc(10 * calc(1em/18)); height: calc(8 * calc(1em/18));"/> be the number of ways the coach can make substitutions during the game (including the possibility of making no substitutions). Find the remainder when <img alt="$n$" class="latex" src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/1/7/4/174fadd07fd54c9afe288e96558c92e0c1da733a.png" style="width: calc(10 * calc(1em/18)); height: calc(8 * calc(1em/18));"/> is divided by 1000.</div>
